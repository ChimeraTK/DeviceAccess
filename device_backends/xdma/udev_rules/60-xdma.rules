# The kernel creates the unique device nodes under /dev. These cannot be changed or renamed.
# (Although this happened to be possible for a while, this is no longer supported).
#
# User-space (udev) can add any symbolic links to the kernel-created device node.
# A helper program (which can be a script) can be invoked for more complex names for symbolic links.
# Based on the unique kernel name (%k) a path for the symbolic link is created (%c).
