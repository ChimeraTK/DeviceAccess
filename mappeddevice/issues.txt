- Why is the iterator on std::pair<dmapElem, mapfilePrt>? 
  The dmapelement should contain the pointer
- Why not use std::pointer on the vector inside? What is the benefit of the
  extra iterator? (which does not have < operator, -> operator etc)
- No const iterators in mapFile
- Why is devMap templated? Shoud use shared_ptr<devBase>.
