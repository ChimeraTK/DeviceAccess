# This script is only intended for internal use at DESY. It is created because
# automated generation with CMake is more convenient and easier to maintain
# than reverse-engeneering the package names using 'ls', 'grep' etc.
# In addition it can serve as a template for other debian installations.
#
# Trying to execute this, even at DESY, will probably fail due to a lack of
# priviliges. This script is intendet to be used by MTCA4U maintainers at DESY
# only.

# Run 'make debian_package" before you execute this script.
