This project uses the ChimeraTK project-template.

It contains some files (like this one) which should not be changed
inside the project. The files should be improved in a generic way in the
project-template and are afterwards merged into all projects which use the
project-template. Like this it is easier to improve the build scripts and
keep them consistent across projects.
