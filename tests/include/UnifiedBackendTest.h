/**
 *  Class to test any backend for correct behavior. Instantiate this class and call all (!) preparatory functions to
 *  provide the tests with the backend-specific test actions etc. Finally call runTests() to execute all tests.
 *  Internally the BOOST unit test framework is used, so this shall be called inside a normal unit test.
 * 
 *  Failing to call all preparatory functions will result in an error. This allows a safe test schema evolution - if
 *  more backend specific actions for enabling and disabling test conditions are needed for the tests and the backend
 *  test has not yet been updated, tests will fail.
 * 
 *  Actions are usually speficied as list of pairs of functors. The pair's first element is always the action to enable
 *  the the test condition, the second is the action to disable it. By providing multiple entries in the lists it is
 *  possible to test several code paths the backend has to end up in the intended test condition.
 *  For example in case of forceRuntimeErrorOnRead(): runtime_errors in a read can be caused by a timeout in the
 *  communication channel, or by a bad reply of the device. Two list entries would be provided in this case, one to make
 *  read operations run into timeouts, and one to make the (dummy) device reply with garbage.
 *  If only one singe code path exists to get to the test condition, it is perfectly fine to have only a single entry
 *  in the list.
 * 
 *  In the same way as for the actions, names of registers etc. are provided as lists, so all test can be repeated for
 *  different registers, if required for full coverage.
 * 
 *  Note: This is work in progress. Tests are by far not yet complete. Interface changes of the test class are also
 *  likely.
