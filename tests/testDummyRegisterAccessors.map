#An area with 16 sequences of mixed types. It is supposed to have 4096 samples in each sequence.
#There are 52 bytes in the sum of all sequences, so there are 212992 bytes (size).
#The number of elements in the AREA field is just 212992 / 4, because it is just the instruction for the
#transport layer how many bytes/32-bit words to transfer. The ratio always must be 4 with all current numerically
#addressed backends.
#The area is intentionally starting at an offset to test this.
