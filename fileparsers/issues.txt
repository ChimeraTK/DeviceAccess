Issues:
- getters shoud not be void but return something (a reference?)
- naming: mapFile is not a file. it's more a map
- make predicates and functors nested
- why is dmapFile and mapFile constructor private?
- dmapFileParser vs dmapFilesParser -> confusing names
- exceptions with IDs: rather use different Exceptions (easier to read? easier to catch?)

Ideas:
- Parser should be used inside the constructor. User should not have to bother about the parser
- Decouple exceptions?
- Getting rid of the dmap file?
  - Open all devices that are supported
  - Determine the devide ID and the firmware version
  - Load the correct mapping file for this ID and firmware
  o +correlation mapping file <-> firmware and ID is hard coded, no errors
    due to mismatch in the config file
  o -No runtime information for firmware development, less flexible
  o -No user configurable names for the indivdual devices
  o Make dmap file optional? 
    - Get input in case of unkonwn firmware versions/ devices
    - Override option for the defaults? (only for debugging anyhow)
    - Print error/ do not run in case of mismatch?
