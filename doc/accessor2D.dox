\page accessor2d 2D Register Accessors

A TwoDRegisterAccessor behaves like a two-dimensional array, consisting of several
sequences (or channels) which each have a number of samples. It is implemented as a
buffering accessor, so you do read() and write() to access the hardware, and in between
you can modify the data in the accessors buffer efficiently at will.

The one-dimensional sequences/channels are implemeted as std::vector, so they are
convenient to use. They are accessed via the [] operator of the accessor. This 
also allows the "matrix" syntax \c accessor[][].
\note As with all std::vectors, iterators are slightly more efficient because the repeated
calculation of the address and indirections are not necessary for each element.
